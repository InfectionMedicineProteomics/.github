The infection medicine proteomics lab (IMP) headed by Professor Johan Malmstr√∂m develops quantitative and structural proteomics techniques to characterize the molecular mechanisms behind bacterial infections. The major goals include: 1) develop new structural proteomics techniques to investigate protein-protein interaction networks between host and pathogens 2) determine the properties characterizing a protective antibody response against bacterial pathogens and 3) determine biomarker panels associated with the onset of organ dysfunction in sepsis. The overall research vision is to provide improved understanding of the molecular interplay between host and pathogen at a systems-wide level that ultimately will lead to the development of new preventive, diagnostic and treatment opportunities for severe infections.
